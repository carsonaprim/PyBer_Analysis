This chart shows our results for the analyzed data, and it shows that there is less competition in rural areas, and those drivers are able to charge more per trip because of that. In the urban areas, there is significantly more demand and a lot more drivers, and therefore less profit per ride and per driver. As can possibly be assumed, with Suburban area being a middle point between the other two, it is in the middle for both demand and profit per ride.
## Summary
First the rural areas can be refined by adding a couple more drivers, but the profit per ride will still be extraordinarily high. This will result in said drivers leveling the profit to the other city types while working less.
The Urban areas can see an overall increase in fares, as with there being a high demand, there can be a higher price.
My best recommendation is that the drivers be able to pass throughout multiple areas, as most places have a combination of the three, and that is the best way to make it "fair" per se, as it will balance out the profits the most for the "employees"
